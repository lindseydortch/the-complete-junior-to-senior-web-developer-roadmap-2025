# OPTIONAL: React + Redux + Module Bundling

## Angular Vs React Vs Vue Vs Svelte
- The top 3 freeworks 
  - Angular 
  - React
  - Vue 
- All of them have the goal of managing large applications on the frontend that have a lot of JavaScript 
- These libraries and frameworks are tools, each one of them is perfect for its own specific use case -- senior devs know this 
  - Each one has pros and cons and a senior developer knows which is good for the problem at hand 
  - There is no one tool that will solve for everything 
  - You need to be able to adapt to the new tools 
  - As a senior dev you need to be able to say this is good for this problem and know the pros and cons 
- Angular
  - Is a framework - they offer an entire kitchen and it is opinionated for if you have a lot of developers you can make sure everyone is using the same kitchen 
  - This would be good for banks 
  - Think of it as the kitchen 
- React 
  - A company with a strong developer team and also needs to be flexible and evolve  by adding different libraries and tools to the ecosystem and I can trust developers to build on top of react with all of these different tools 
  - Think of React as the oven, we get more flexibility 
- Vue 
  - A simple way of writing code that is friendly and if you hire a lot of junior developers 
  - Think of Vue as the microwave, it's super simple to pick up 
- We don't want to think in terms of absolutes 
  - However, React does stand above the others with the most downloads based on amount of jobs 
  - React teaches you good JS principals that last a lifetime, with Angular this can be hard to do 

## Important: Thinking Like A Senior Developer
- The goal of this course is not to teach the latest trends, the goal is to show how to think, how to problem solve, how senior developers use their brain in their day to day role to become or to be senior developers 
  - This means we don't worry about the latest version of a library, we learn the principles and the foundation of things, so that no matter what new versions come up in the future, it doesn't really matter 

## Optional Section
- Just a note on how to go through this section if you alreayd have experience with React and module bundling 

## Bruno's Request
- Bruno wants us to add Redux into their React project 

## Section Overview
- Our JS files have grown significantly over time, which caused issues with readability, maintainability, and bug issues 
- Frameworks and libraries help us solve issues with our readability, maintainability and bug maintenance with bigger codebases 
- We will go into React + Redux 
- We will then go into Webpack and bundling 
- We will also feel super comfortable with state management
