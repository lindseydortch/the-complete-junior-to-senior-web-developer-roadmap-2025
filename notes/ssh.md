# SSH 

## Bruno's Request 
- First Task: Set Up SSH With GitHub 

## Introduction to SSH 
- Secure Shell is a protocol 
- Protocol - an agreement of how to communicate between two computers on the internet 
  - HTTP - files between browsers and servers
  - FTP - allows you to upload files 
  - HTTPS - encrypted files between browsers and servers

- SSH 
  - A protocol to use over shell 
  - The shell is your operating system 
  - Client <-- Internet  --> HOST 

## SSH Command 
- ssh {user}@{host} - ssh command 
- Digital Ocean - gives servers for very cheap 
  - Droplets are there version of server 
  - Most servers use Ubuntu 
  - You can copy and paste the IP address they provide you in your own terminal 
- When using Linux or Mac using SSH is very simple, there are more steps for windows users 
- How does this apply to web development? 
  - SSH is a very important concept because you will use all the time 
  - Example: Connecting to GitHub 
    - Pushing, pulling, etc 
  - Example: SSH your home computer 
  - Example: npm install -- ssh into server get the project files and get the app back up and running 

## Optional: Digital Ocean Set Up 
- Code to receive $200 in credit, but only valid for 60 days, make sure to cancel 
- Commands we will be using in the next lecture: 
  - apt-get : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto 
  - rsync : https://www.tecmint.com/rsync-local-remote-file-synchronization-commands/
